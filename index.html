        <p class="lead mb-4">Before transitioning as a freshman to University of California- Riverside, I was a part of my high schoolâ€™s Associated Student Body. I held the position of Senior Class Vice President. I assisted the Senior Class president not only in planning events for the soon to be graduates, but we also coordinated with our principal to make sure all students were meeting the requirements of graduation. Although our year was cut short, we still tried to create fun activities through zoom so students could create memories with their peers. Along with holding this position, I was also elected to be a part of my high school's Interview Committee. The interview committee was made up of two students, staff members, teachers, and our principal. Being a student in this committee allowed us to gage whether or not we felt that the person being interviewed would fit our schools needs the best. It also allowed for us to voice what we felt our school needed and who we would like to see work with our peers and us. Being elected into these roles instilled me to become not only a team player but a leader.<br><br> 
        Outside of high school, I volunteered around the community which led to me becoming engaged in the disparities between people. I wanted to make a change within the stigmas and cultural stereotypes between all races and ethnicities. Because this is something I was passionate about, towards the end of my junior year, I signed up for two internships that intersected with my interests. I joined Latino Service Providers: Testimonios Project as a Youth Promotor, also known as a community health worker. This internship exposed me to vulnerable topics the Latinx Community is shamed for talking about. Along with this internship, I also joined the Sonoma County Junior Commission on Human Rights. Within this internship, I have assisted in creating and organizing an event surrounding immigrant rights. This project has allowed me to educate at the root level and expand knowledge of factual information within the community of Sonoma County. Both of these internships have ingrained a self-awareness of empowerment and pushed me to seek higher education.<br><br>

        Currently, I am a part of a tutoring program here at UCR to try and motivate young students to continue their education. Being a part of this program has allowed me to advocate for educational support for young students of color who are disproportionately behind due to the lack of services in their schools and communities.
